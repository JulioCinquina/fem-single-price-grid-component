## My process

### What I learned

In this project, I have practiced the following skills:

- Using **Grid** and **media queries** to create a **responsive layout**
- Using **Flexbox** to arrange content
- Styling a button's **hover and focus states**
- Styling elements with **box shadows**
- Using **semantic HTML markup**
- Using **CSS relative units** to ensure the text scales according to the user's font size settings
- Using **CSS custom properties** to allow easy customization and reusability of the component
- Using **Git** and **GitHub**

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue learning how to create **responsive, two-dimensional layouts** with **Grid**.
